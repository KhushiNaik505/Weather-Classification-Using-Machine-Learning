# 🌦️ Weather Classification Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify weather conditions using historical weather data. It covers the complete workflow—from data preprocessing and feature analysis to training and evaluating classification models. The goal is to understand how different atmospheric factors influence weather patterns and to compare model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Key Highlights:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature selection and exploratory data analysis

Implementation of machine learning classification algorithms

Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

A beginner-friendly project demonstrating practical application of machine learning concepts in a real-world scenario.
